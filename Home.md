### Welcome to the Chime wiki!

Chime uses the existing Minecraft model, override, and predicate format and expands on it greatly. A familiarity with this format should be considered a prerequisite to working with Chime.

A collection of useful examples can be found [here](https://github.com/emilyalexandra/chime/wiki/Examples).

For a comprehensive list of all predicates Chime uses and supports, and how the data types are formatted, you can go [here](https://github.com/emilyalexandra/chime/wiki/Predicates).
